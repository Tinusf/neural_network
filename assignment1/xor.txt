# layers is a comma-separated list of integers telling us how many nodes in each
# hidden layer. Special case: If the value is only one element in the list, and
# its value is 0, you should generate a net without a hidden layer
layers = 5, 5

# activations is a comma-separated list of key-words. It will have as many
# elements as there are elements in the layers-list. Each keyword is a
# non-linearity function, and legal values are relu, linear, and tanh.
activations = tanh, tanh
